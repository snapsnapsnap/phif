Perfect Host Image Frame

Pre-Story: Imagine the perfect housewife. She will have a visitor over for dinner. the then goes to the storage room,
finds a picture of herself, and the guest that visits, and places it on the mantle. The guests arrive, and see the
picture of himself and the host... thinking wow.. I am an important person to this hosts.  When the guest leave
the host puts the picture back in the storage, and prepares for the next guests.

Parts:

1. Image frame, capable of showing images, either static or as a slideshow
2. Image server, a place to store the images, including extra data such as tags (people tagged, both friends, and host)
3. what to show engine, could be based on either image recognition (real time) or a schedule (calendar integration?)


Notes:

-Could be used in a professional setting as well, a meeting room PC, could prepare images of the participants for
a meeting scheduled for that room for that time

-The What To Show Engine (WTSE) can have several algorithms, but my initial plan is to have pictures in any given time
that shows a) one of the HOST pictures (any family member living in household), and b) one of the GUEST pictures in the
same image, giving priority to 1) starred images, and 2) groupd photos with several of a) and b). 

-parts can be replaced by APIs, maybe facebook or Google+ for image tags, if possible. 

-Could make Windows, MAC, Linux versions.
